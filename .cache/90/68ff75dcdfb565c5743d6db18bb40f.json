For example, suppose a user says \"I want pizza\", your bot sends\n *       this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user request is\n *       for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in\n *       user conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required information (slot values, such as\n *       pizza size and crust type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when\n *       you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your Amazon Lex bot.

Each endpoint provides a set of\n *       operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the runtime API to understand user utterances\n *       (user input text or voice). For example, suppose a user says \"I want pizza\", your bot sends\n *       this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user request is\n *       for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in\n *       user conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required information (slot values, such as\n *       pizza size and crust type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when\n *       you created the bot). You use the build-time API to create and manage your Amazon Lex bot.
